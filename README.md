1. Simple

2. Most-at-once Delivery
3. Ordered Message
4. Horizontal Scaling

### Status

### Plan

#### Consumer Lopp Rule

Add new-message subscribtion for the consumer which has been waiting for long time.

1. [ ] Use interface mock.

2. [ ] Build benthmark.

#### Load Balancing
1. [ ] Build center/master to collect the all nodes/service status

  1. Node <=> Database
  2. Consumer <=> Node

2. [ ] Shard the key in Database?

#### Admin page
1. [ ] System health monitoring.

1. [ ] User management, `acess_key`, `api_key`.
